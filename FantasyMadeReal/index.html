          <h3>Victor's Story</h3>
          <p>
            Meeting Tomilola has been a blessing in my life and I can‚Äôt stop
            thanking God for the gift of her in my life. I met Tomi at my place
            of work. She had just came in as a new staff and I can say it was
            almost a situation of Love at first sight.
            <br />
            I tried getting close to her, but I realized she was in a
            relationship (I got to know when she posted the guy on his birthday
            and also what she saved his number with), so I left it at just
            friendship, I didn‚Äôt tell her my intentions.
          </p>

      </div>
      <div class="loveStory2">
        <div class="loveStoryText2">
          <p>
            We became friends, we would talk after work and then I realized she
            needed an apartment, so I offered to help with movement since I am
            mobile, we started house hunting, we would meet every Sunday
            afternoon and sometimes after close of work to meet with different
            house agents till she was able to get what she likes
            <br />

            It was during this period I realized how much I love her, She is so
            reserved and gentle, coupled with some other traits I had seen
            earlier so I told her about my feelings for her, and as expected,
            she said she was in a relationship and that was it, I stopped
            talking about it but I maintained my friendship with her.

            However, things went south between them (herself and her now ex),
            and I got to know the relationship ended months after it ended.
            <br />

            I allowed her heal, then I asked her out again, she said she needed
            to pray about it, this took months, but in the end, here we are,
            about to walk down the aisle and spend the rest of our lives
            together.

          <h3>Tomi's Story</h3>
          <p>
            You really can find love anywhere! I met Victor at my former place
            of work, I just got this job and upon resumption, I was attached to
            someone just to get familiar with how they work there. During one of
            the introductions to old staff, he introduced me to Victor and said
            ‚Äúthis is our Head, RMC, you‚Äôll meet him for anything concrete‚Äù
            <br />

            I remembered we started talking the day he offered to give me a ride
            home after work, this was when I realized he‚Äôs a Yoruba man, all
            along I thought he was Hausa, because he speaks so fluently.

          <p>
            We started talking and sometimes he would plead that I stay back
            after work on days he has some works to finish up before closing and
            in my mind I would be like, ‚Äúis this one okay? What does he want, me
            I‚Äôm in a relationship oh‚Äù‚Ä¶you know this feeling you have when you
            know someone is up to something üåö
            <br />

            I would wait a while and leave afterwards. Just as he said, he was
            very helpful when I was looking for apartment and I appreciated him,
            but I had not started having feelings for him.

            I was in a relationship and we were having issues, I didn‚Äôt want to
            get myself confused, so I turned him down when he asked me out.
            <br />
            Things ended with my ex, and one way or the other he got to know,
            then he brought up the discussion again, I had started praying about
            him before he got to know my relationship ended, but I haven‚Äôt
            gotten any go ahead.

            Then when he came back the second time, I told him I needed to seek
            God‚Äôs face, I did, had my conviction, and here we are.
            <br />
            We didn‚Äôt want to work in the same place, so we told God to further
            confirm our union by providing one of us another job, just few days
            to our introduction, God provided another job for one of us.

          <br />It is not proud. It does not dishonor others. It is not

          It always protects. Always trust. Always hopes. Always perseveres!
